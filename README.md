# DCI in Haxe
[Haxe](http://haxe.org) is a nice multiplatform language which enables a full DCI implementation. If you don't know what DCI is, keep reading, you're in for a treat!

## Short introduction
DCI stands for Data, Context, Interaction. The key aspects of the DCI architecture are:

- Separating what the system *is* (data) from what it *does* (function). Data and function have different rates of change so they should be separated, not as it currently is, put in classes together.
- Create a direct mapping from the user's mental model to code. The computer should think as the user, not the other way around.
- Make system behavior a first class entity.
- Great code readability with no surprises at runtime.

## Example/Demo
Browse to the [haxedci-example](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxedci-example) repository for a syntax explanation of the library, a longer introduction to DCI, and a demo.

## Download and Install
Install via [haxelib](http://haxe.org/doc/haxelib/using_haxelib): `haxelib install haxedci`

Then put `-lib haxedci` into your hxml.

## Technical notes
Because of the special syntax, there are some problems with autocompletion for Roles. When inside a Role, not all of its RoleMethods may show up. The compiler seems to stop early. Also you will only get autocompletion for RoleMethods if you set a return value explicitly. If you want warnings for the occational slip of mind (debug mode only), define `-D dci-signatures-warnings`.
